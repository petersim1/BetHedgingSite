            <h6>This site takes in 3 fields:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial Wager - <span>amount you originally placed on your bet</span></li>
                <li>Initial Profit - <span>amount you would win off your initial wager</span></li>
                <li>Hedge Odds - <span>American odds (ie +200 , -120) of the opposing bet</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>This assumes a zero-sum outcome. This means that either your original wager, 
                OR the opposing must occur</p>
            <p>Further, hedging will reduce your potential winnings, but ensure a profit 
                (unless the bet you are hedging has terrible odds)</p>

            <h6>Possible scenarios where this is of use:</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You placed a parlay, and all legs have hit except the last one. 
                    You panic and want to ensure yourself a win, so you hedge the 
                    final outcome. <span class='get-example'>Get example</span>
                </li>
                <div class='scenario'>
                    <p>
                        Let's say you took a 5 team parlay. The first 4 have hit. You have team "A" winning in 
                        the last leg of your parlay, but instead of "riding it out", you decide that you want to 
                        ensure yourself a profit. What you'd do is take team "A" to lose.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <li>
                    You placed a wager at the beginning of the game, and now want to use Live Odds to hedge 
                    the outcome <span class='get-example'>Get example</span>
                </li>
                <div class='scenario'>
                    <p>
                        Let's say you took team "A" to win before a game started, 
                        they are now winning, so the odds of them winning becomes more expensive, 
                        so you hedge by taking team "A" to lose, in the case they lose their lead.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <li>
                    You placed a future bet on a team to win the championship before the 
                    season started. Now they are in the championship game and you 
                    want to hedge the outcome. <span class='get-example'>Get example</span>
                </li>
                <div class='scenario'>
                    <p>
                        Let's say you took team "A" to win the championship early in the season 
                        (or took some other future bet, such as having more than a certain number of wins), 
                        which typically will have pretty poor odds. Now team "A" is in the championship 
                        (or has a higher likelihood of hitting your future bet), so you hedge the outcome by 
                        taking the opposite bet.
